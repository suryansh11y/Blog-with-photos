<p id="java">Mountains</p>
<p>A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally considered to be steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the Earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. </p>

<p id="java">Oceans</p>
<p>The ocean water is saline because of the vast amount of salts dissolved in it. The salinity of oceans is not the same everywhere. We get sodium chloride or common salt and many other chemicals by evaporating seawater. The degree of salinity varies from place to place.</p>

<p id="java">Volcano</p>
<p>A place from where hot molten lava along with hot gases, escapes from below the earth, usually found at mountain tops is what volcanoes are. Mostly when the volcanic crater gets active is when these hot steam, ash, rock and lava come out.</p>
